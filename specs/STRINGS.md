# Strings

Strings in Nim can be delimited by single-quotes (') or double-quotes ("). Backslashes are used to express the string delimiter inside a string. For example, `print() "I said \"Hello!\" to him today.";` will print `I said "Hello!" to him today.`, and `print() "Hi there!\";--><!--";` will print `Hi there!";--><!--` and not simply `Hi there!`.
