# Numbers

Numbers in Nim can come in a multitude of forms, including decimal (`19.3842075`), binary (`0b10110011101001`), octal (`0o13740652`), hexadecimal (`0xE1C478A935BD2F`), and plain integer (`19345`). Numbers are parsed by JavaScript's `Number()` cast function, and therefore number formats are identical to JavaScript's.
